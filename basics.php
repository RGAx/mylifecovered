                            <h4>Term Life Insurance</h4>
                            <p class="margin-bottom-m">Term life insurance is an easy and affordable option for young families. Term life provides coverage for a specific period of time, typically the years you expect to need coverage the most, by filling the gap left by the loss of your income and protecting your assets by paying off debts. In doing so, it covers financial obligations that disappear over time, such as a mortgage, college tuition and loans. The healthier and younger you are, the more affordable coverage will be.</p>

                            <p style="display: none;">Your application process will include identifying yourself and your beneficiaries, as well as answering a few initial health questions. You will also undergo a paramedical exam. Depending on your age and the amount of coverage you're requesting, this could include: family and personal medical history questions; height, weight &amp; body measurement; fluid specimens; and an EKG to measure the performance of your heart.</p>

                            <p style="display: none;">Most applicants are approved. A few factors may cause the carrier to decline you, such as certain cancers within the past five years. Once approved, you will receive your calculated premium and your policy for acceptance and signing. After paying your first premium (annual, quarterly or monthly payments), the carrier will put your policy in force. At this point, your policy cannot be cancelled unless you fail to pay your premiums according to the provisions of the agreement.</p>
