# QA Issues - MLC v2.1

- Fonts are not loading on the following pages:
  - ```aboutus.do```
  - ```contactus.do```
  - ```privacypolicy.do```
  - ```terms.do```
  - ```legalInformatiion.do```
  - ```policyForms.do```
  - ```financialRatings.do```
  - ```blood.do```
  - ```life-help.do```
  - ```life-need.do```
  - ```life-afford.do```
- This is the error I see for the font loading issue:
  - ```Typekit: the domain "devweb01.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com" isn't in the list of published domains for kit "qns3hng".```
- Entering data and clicking GO on the three new path pages (```life-help.do```, ```life-need.do```, ```life-afford.do```) does not redirect to the Quote Form. It appends a string to the URL (for example, ```life-afford.do?coverageAmount=50```), but the page does not advance.
- The new styles are not being called for the three old vanity URL landing pages. I made the following changes to each file (```welcomeDropdown.jsp```, ```welcomeCalculateNeed.jsp```, ```welcomeTwentyFiveDollars.jsp```) to fix the issue:
  - Set ```xperience.css``` as the main CSS file after ```mylifecovered-metcon.min.css```, not ```styles.css``` or ```nav.css```
  - Changed the IDs of the ```<section id="hero" class="section-photo cover">``` element in each file to match the new CSS
  - Got rid of ```remodal.css``` and ```remodal-default-theme.css``` because they are not being used
  - Replaced an ```<html>``` tag with a ```</div>``` tag at the top of ```footer.jsp```
- **Mohan, if you will give me access to your GitHub at https://github.com/mohankumarac12/MyLifeCovered, I will commit my changes so you have them**
- On ```calculator.do```, the button labeled Quick Facts is linking to ```quote-form.do```, which does not exist. I believe it should instead just load the main Quote form.
- When first landing on the multicarrier quote, the Amount of Coverage number at the bottom says $700,000 no matter what coverage amount is selected on the previous screen
- On the multicarrier quote, all dollar amounts should have two decimal places (for example, $11.50/mo instead of $11.5/mo)
- On the multicarrier quote, the Lincoln Life premium isn't updating when dragging the Amount of Coverage slider; it stays suck at $59/mo unless you adjust the Number of Years to Maintain Coverage. Is this correct?
- On the multicarrier quote, no phone numbers are displaying after the word Call
