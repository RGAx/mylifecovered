<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Move from three landing pages to one, with the new landing page featuring tiles for Athletic Blood Profile and Life Insurance for the Healthy</li>
<li>Integrate a child-level landing page for WellnessFX (Athletic Blood Profile) and link to custom WellnessFX page for My Life Covered</li>
<li>Introduce a new user experience design style from XperienceLabs across the entire site</li>

<li>Install WordPress in a new directory to provide blog functionality</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="vanityurllandingpages">Vanity URL Landing Pages</h3>

<ul>
<li>These pages remain in place to capture traffic from the print magazine ads</li>
<li>Only way to land on one of these is via a print ad URL</li>
<li>Taking any action inside these landing pages will take the user into the new experience</li>
<li>All markup stays the same, but a few styles are adjusted/improved</li>
<li>Red banners are removed</li>
<li>Print ads also carry different phone numbers, which are associated with each landing page.</li>
<li>Mindtree should continue dynamically changing the phone number below the logo to match the phone numbers in the URL.</li>
<li>Staging/preview links:</li>
<li>Affordability ($25 per month)

<ul>
<li>http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-affordability.php</li>
<li>This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/welcome.do?phoneNo=866&#8211;515&#8211;8992&amp;src=affordability. The user should only see this page if they are sent via one of the vanity URLs. The only difference is in CSS styles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calculate Need (Two Buttons)

<ul>
<li>http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-calculateneed.php</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="headernav">Header / Nav</h3>

<ul>
<li>Within the Life Insurance view/path, four links are visible:</li>
<li>Learn The Basics</li>
<li>12 Common Misconceptions</li>
<li>Fitness For Life (blog category)</li>
<li>Life Prepared (blog category)</li>
<li>If the user is not within the Life Insurance view/path, only the following links are visible</li>
<li>Fitness For Life (blog category)</li>
<li>Life Prepared (blog category)</li>
<li>The link to Get A Quote, currently shown in Zeplin, should go away in all scenarios</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="footer">Footer</h3>

<ul>
<li>All pages should keep the style and content of the existing site footer</li>
<li>Footer will have a dark grey background as opposed to red so as not to conflict with the hover/active state of the tiles at the bottom of the new landing pages</li>
</ul>
