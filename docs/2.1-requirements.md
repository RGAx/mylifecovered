## Goals

- Move from three landing pages to one, with the new landing page featuring tiles for Athletic Blood Profile and Life Insurance for the Healthy
- Integrate a child-level landing page for WellnessFX (Athletic Blood Profile) and link to custom WellnessFX page for My Life Covered
- Introduce a new user experience design style from XperienceLabs across the entire site
- Offer the multi-carrier view on the life insurance quote page
- Install WordPress in a new directory to provide blog functionality

## Requirements

### Vanity URL Landing Pages

- These pages remain in place to capture traffic from the print magazine ads
- Only way to land on one of these is via a print ad URL
- Taking any action inside these landing pages will take the user into the new experience
- All markup stays the same, but a few styles are adjusted/improved
- Red banners are removed
- Print ads also carry different phone numbers, which are associated with each landing page.
  - Mindtree should continue dynamically changing the phone number below the logo to match the phone numbers in the URL.
- Staging/preview links:
  - Affordability ($25 per month)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-affordability.php
    - This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/welcome.do?phoneNo=866-515-8992&src=affordability. The user should only see this page if they are sent via one of the vanity URLs. The only difference is in CSS styles.
  - Calculate Need (Two Buttons)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-calculateneed.php
    - This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/welcome.do?phoneNo=866-515-8992&src=calculateneed. The user should only see this page if they are sent via one of the vanity URLs. The only difference is in CSS styles.
  - I Know What I Want (Dropdown)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-iknowwhatiwant.php
    - This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/welcome.do?phoneNo=866-515-8992&src=iknowwhatiwant. The user should only see this page if they are sent via one of the vanity URLs. The only difference is in CSS styles.

### Header / Nav

- Within the Life Insurance view/path, four links are visible:
  - Learn The Basics
  - 12 Common Misconceptions
  - Fitness For Life (blog category)
  - Life Prepared (blog category)
- If the user is not within the Life Insurance view/path, only the following links are visible
  - Fitness For Life (blog category)
  - Life Prepared (blog category)
- The link to Get A Quote, currently shown in Zeplin, should go away in all scenarios

### Footer

- All pages should keep the style and content of the existing site footer
- Footer will have a dark grey background as opposed to red so as not to conflict with the hover/active state of the tiles at the bottom of the new landing pages

> **Switzer Staging Link:** http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/calculator.php

- This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/calculator.do. Small changes have been made to the markup to add text and new buttons at the top for **Quick Facts** and **Calculator**.
- User choices/actions:

### Quote - Form

> **Zeplin Link:** https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e93b21548a300073e9532e
> **Switzer Staging Link:** http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/quote-form.php

- This is NOT a new page. This page is a copy of https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/selectedCoverage.do. Small changes have been made to the markup to add text and new buttons at the top for **Quick Facts** and **Calculator**.
- The screen in Zeplin does not show a coverage amount / premium amount field; it needs to be included in the markup. The screen shows annual income, which should only be visible if they entered income. Here is what we want:
  - User enters annual income: Show Annual Income & Coverage Amount
  - User enters coverage amount: Show only Coverage Amount
  - User enters premium amount: Show only Premium Amount
  - Fields that would be blank, should be hidden to avoid the user typing something in and confusing the quoting process.
- User choices/actions:
  - Clicking the **Full Calculator** tab takes the user to the Calculator page:
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/calculator.php
  - Filling out the form and clicking the **See Your Quote** button takes the user to the Quote - Recommended page:

- The user should also end up with this quote if they come to this page after filling out the calculator at http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/calculator.php first and then filling out the quote form at http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/quote-form.php second

### Blog

> **Switzer Staging Link:** http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/blog

- The most recent article is always featured first at the top of the left main column
- Yesterday's featured article, and the featured article from the day prior to that, are featured in the right sidebar column
- Below the main featured article is a running list, in reverse chronological order, of all articles
- After 10 articles, pagination will be displayed at the bottom of the page for the user to navigate backward through time to the previous 10 articles
- There should be a search function on the blog where a person could enter text and see all articles matching in a results list (Should probably look like the articles beyond the 3 featured on the regular blog page, without the featured three of course)
- Switzer is building a WordPress theme. Mindtree will need to install WordPress in a folder on the site at https://www.mylifecovered.net/blog. When Switzer has completed the theme, they will place it in GitHub and send Mindtree a copy of the database. Mindtree will need to upload and activate the theme in WordPress and import the database.

### Responsiveness / Mobile

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b5b50aaed105c6aeac

- All pages will be responsive and tested in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer 11
- Instead of displaying all child-level landing page content here below the main grey center widget, the two tile buttons (eventually four) will be displayed cleanly at the bottom of the page
  - This will allow the user to click and open those child-level landing pages so their journey / pageviews can be tracked
