## Goals

- Move from three landing pages to one, with the new landing page featuring tiles for Athletic Blood Profile and Life Insurance for the Healthy
- Integrate a child-level landing page for WellnessFX (Athletic Blood Profile) and link to custom WellnessFX page for My Life Covered
- Introduce a new user experience design style from XperienceLabs across the entire site
- Offer the multi-carrier view on the life insurance quote page
- Install WordPress in a new directory to provide blog functionality

## Requirements

### Vanity URL Landing Pages

- These pages remain in place to capture traffic from the print magazine ads
- Only way to land on one of these is via a print ad URL
- Taking any action inside these landing pages will take the user into the new experience
- All markup stays the same, but a few styles are adjusted/improved
- Red banners are removed
- Print ads also carry different phone numbers, which are associated with each landing page.
  - Mindtree should continue dynamically changing the phone number below the logo to match the phone numbers in the URL.
- Staging/preview links:
  - Affordability ($25 per month)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-affordability.php
  - Calculate Need (Two Buttons)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-calculateneed.php
  - I Know What I Want (Dropdown)
    - http://mylifecovered.switzercreative.com/welcome-iknowwhatiwant.php

### Header / Nav

- Within the Life Insurance view/path, four links are visible:
  - Learn The Basics
  - 12 Common Misconceptions
  - Fitness For Life (blog category)
  - Life Prepared (blog category)
- If the user is not within the Life Insurance view/path, only the following links are visible
  - Fitness For Life (blog category)
  - Life Prepared (blog category)
- The link to Get A Quote, currently shown in Zeplin, should go away in all scenarios

### Footer

- All pages should keep the style and content of the existing site footer
- Footer will have a dark grey background as opposed to red so as not to conflict with the hover/active state of the tiles at the bottom of the new landing pages

### Home

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b6b50aaed105c6aeea

- Include only two of the four eventual tiles:
  - Athletic Blood Profile
  - Life Insurance for the Healthy
- Hovering over or clicking on a tile makes it red
- Clicking on Athletic Blood Profile takes the user to the WellnessFX child-level landing page
  - https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935bbc5397afa2c5b177b
- Clicking on Life Insurance for the Healthy takes the user to the redesigned Life Insurance landing page and ask the user to input his/her annual income
  - https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b7819aaad308ac788b

### Athletic Blood Profile

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935bbc5397afa2c5b177b

- Clicking on the **Learn More** button will take the user to https://www.wellnessfx.com/my-life-covered

### Life Insurance Child-Level Landing

- These will actually be three separate pages, each with a different option selected in the top half of the grey center widget:
  - Help Me Determine My Coverage
    - https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b7819aaad308ac788b
    - Inputting annual income and clicking **GO** takes the user to the Quote page where both annual income and coverage amount (10x annual income) are pre-populated in the form
  - I Know How Much I Need
    - https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b86938643264abc368
    - Selecting total coverage from the dropdown and clicking **GO** takes the user to the Quote page with coverage amount (what they just selected) pre-populated in the form
  - I Know How Much I Can Afford
    - https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b9819aaad308ac78df
    - Inputting amount/month and clicking **GO** takes the user to the Quote page with premium amount (instead of coverage amount) pre-populated in the form
- For all inputs, the Mindtree team needs to be sure to strip the input to get rid of any dollar signs or commas typed by the user before passing the integer through to the quote page
- For all to the three quoting options, there is a link to the OLD calculator in text, just above the data entry area. This is titled: “See our full Calculator”. While obscure, it allows a person to go the long way to get to a quote.

### Calculator

- Need to ensure that, if a user clicks the “Calculate Need” heading and goes to the full calculator, if they think in their head, “Oops, I don’t want to do that”, and they hit the back function of the browser, that they are returned to their quote calculator page, in its previous state with no revision or loss of data.

### Get A Quote - Form

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e93b21548a300073e9532e

- The screen in Zeplin does not show a coverage amount / premium amount field; it needs to be included in the markup. The screen shows annual income, which should only be visible if they entered income. Here is what we want:
  - User enters annual income: Show Annual Income & Coverage Amount
  - User enters coverage amount: Show only Coverage Amount
  - User enters premium amount: Show only Premium Amount
  - Fields that would be blank, should be hidden to avoid the user typing something in and confusing the quoting process.
- To the right of the form, disclaimer text will be displayed in the same manor/style as the current iteration:
  - https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/quote.do
- Clicking the **Full Calculator** tab at the top loads the calculator in the same manor/style as the current iteration:
  - https://www.mylifecovered.net/myLifeCovered/calculator.do

### Get A Quote - Recommended

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e9360282628a9010a13111

- User arrives at this quote if he/she followed the "Help Me Determine My Coverage" or "I Know How Much I Need" path
- The user should also end up with this quote if they entered the OLD long needs calculator process.
- Clicking the **Apply Now** button takes the user into the Rgility fulfillment system
- Dragging the sliders at the bottom of the page adjusts the coverage amount and the term length
- Carriers other than Transamerica are not clickable; user will call the number displayed on the screen

### Get A Quote - Recommended Alternate

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935ff5bbec98772468d24

- User arrives at this quote if he/she followed the "I Know What I Can Afford" path
- Styles are identitcal to those of the standard Get A Quote - Recommended page, but the monthly premium and total coverage amounts switch places

### Blog

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935d66938643264abc9d0

- The most recent article is always featured first at the top of the left main column
- Yesterday's featured article, and the featured article from the day prior to that, are featured in the right sidebar column
- Below the main featured article is a running list, in reverse chronological order, of all articles
- After 10 articles, pagination will be displayed at the bottom of the page for the user to navigate backward through time to the previous 10 articles
- Switzer will build a WordPress theme with all content structure and style included; this can be uploaded and activated on the WordPress install that Mindtree sets up
- There should be a search function on the blog where a person could enter text and see all articles matching in a results list (Should probably look like the articles beyond the 3 featured on the regular blog page, without the featured three of course

### Responsiveness / Mobile

> https://app.zeplin.io/project.html#pid=57e5a7c6548a300073ddf6c1&sid=57e935b5b50aaed105c6aeac

- Instead of displaying all child-level landing page content here below the main grey center widget, the two tile buttons (eventually four) will be displayed cleanly at the bottom of the page
  - This will allow the user to click and open those chhild-level landing pages so their journey / pageviews can be tracked
