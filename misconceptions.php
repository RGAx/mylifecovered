                                    <p style="display: none;">The amount of life insurance you need is specific to your situation. Generally, 8-10 times your income is a good rule of thumb. MY LIFE COVERED™ offers a needs calculator to help you find out just how much coverage is right for you.</p>

                                    <h3>You are too young to worry about life insurance</h3>
                                    <p style="display: none;">The younger you get your coverage, the lower your premiums will be. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to develop medical conditions that exaggerate the premium cost to you. If you buy when you're young and in great health, your premium is locked in – even when you convert to another life insurance product in most cases.</p>

                                    <p style="display: none;">Many employers provide group life insurance to employees. While this may provide a healthy baseline, many experts recommend 8-10 times your income in coverage to safeguard your dependents’ future needs. And these policies can rarely be taken with you if you leave employment.</p>

                                    <p style="display: none;">For most people, life insurance is a necessity. But if you have sizable assets and no debt, or if you have no dependents or heirs you want to provide for, you are probably better off "self-insuring.” Save enough to cover your final expenses and you won't need life insurance under the conditions we've outlined.</p>

                                    <h3>I don't need to worry about my health for life insurance</h3>
                                    <p style="display: none;">Insurance companies gauge the risk of all applicants. High risk to the insurer means high premiums, often for low coverage policies. Fit individuals have a very high likelihood of getting the best price and the most coverage, as health markers usually indicate a long and enjoyable life span.</p>

                                    <p style="display: none;">Buying term life insurance and investing funds elsewhere isn’t right for everyone. Providing for a special needs child or covering estate taxes are two typical reasons to have permanent insurance.</p>

                                    <h3>The medical exam and evaluation is just a formality</h3>
                                    <p style="display: none;">Your health history is instrumental in setting your premium. Occupation, hobbies, medical history, family history, and driving record give an insurer a window into your health and even likelihood to put your life at risk. All of these are factors in setting your premium. For healthy people like you, you could see premiums that are less than half of those paid by the average insured.</p>

                                    <p style="display: none;">There is a point in time for some people where investments have amassed enough volume that they don't need life insurance any longer. For most younger Americans, accumulated savings and investments would do little more than cover final expenses. If your investments do not meet the needs of your loved ones, you may need life insurance.</p>

                                    <h3>Life Insurance Is Really Expensive</h3>
                                    <p style="display: none;">Some people tend to over-estimate the cost of life insurance by 3 to 8 times the actual cost.&nbsp; The low rates can be surprising. For example, a 30-year old female athlete, wanting coverage to last for 20 years to cover $475,000 for her mortgage and kids through college, could have premiums as low as $22 a month, and premiums will be lower if paid annually.This term life insurance rate is listed for Transamerica Life Insurance Trendsetter Super product based on preferred plus class coverage, Policy Forms ICC16 TL22, TL22, 1-322 11-107, 1-306 11-107, 1-305 11-107, 1-304 11-107, 1-303 11-107, or 1-334 11-107. Transamerica Life Insurance Company is located in Cedar Rapids IA 52499. Premiums increase beginning in year 21 for the 20-year policy. Policy form and number may vary. Insurance eligibility and premiums are subject to underwriting.</p>

                                    <h3>My Premiums Are Tax Deductible</h3>
                                    <p style="display: none;">In most cases, premiums are not tax deductible. But the good news is, since your premiums come from after tax dollars, the entire value of your life insurance is paid to your beneficiaries, non-taxable. Contact your tax advisor regarding questions about possible income, estate and gift tax consequences.</p>

                                    <p style="display: none;">Most people think that since a non-working partner makes no income, there is nothing there to insure. The loss of a non-working partner would require a need for additional services to care for your family, such as childcare. In addition, life insurance allows the surviving partner to take some unpaid time off work to help the family adjust to their loss.</p>
