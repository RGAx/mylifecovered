                    <p>I'm Todd Seabaugh, a CrossFit® Affiliate owner and athlete since 2008. While attending the 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games® in Carson, CA, I was blown away by the dedication and discipline I saw in each and every competitor. I decided shortly after to start promoting life insurance to adult athletes and other super-fit individuals to help them take advantage of higher coverage amounts and lower rates that may be available to them based on their individual health.</p>

                    <p>Because of this lifestyle, we are all stronger both physically and mentally. But family members need a recovery plan in case something happens to us. Today, I want to challenge you to get this done. Will you make the commitment to protect the ones you care about the most?</p>
