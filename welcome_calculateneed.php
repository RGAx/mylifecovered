                    <h3>Do you fit into the BEST CLASS?</h3>
                    <p>The “Best Class” of coverage actually means the lowest cost of insurance, and consists of individuals with great personal and family health histories. Generally, highly fit and active people qualify in this group or “class”. Your frequent exercise regimen tells us that you may qualify for those premiums. To find out for certain, you must complete a no-obligation application.</p>

                    <h3>Would you like the convenience of In-Home HEALTH ANALYSIS?</h3>
                    <p>You will undergo a health analysis as a part of the application process. Lab work will be completed – in the comfort of your own home – that could provide valuable preventative information should health concerns be identified – all with no out-of-pocket cost for you.</p>

                    <h3>Do you rate higher than AVERAGE?</h3>
                    <p>Highly fit and active people make up the majority of the 15-20% of individuals who generally qualify for “best class” premiums. Not everyone falls into this category, but your active lifestyle may help you to qualify for these lower premiums. Should you qualify for the “best class”, your premiums could be up to 40% less than those of “average people” your age.</p>

                    <h3>Are you prepared for a LONG DURATION?</h3>
                    <p>Life insurance coverage can be less expensive at younger ages. So, in most cases, it is best to lock in coverage with more affordable rates at a younger age, than to wait and lock in a more expensive rate in the future. And, once you’re covered, your premium will lock in for the duration of the policy; which can range from 10 to 30 years.</p>

                    <h3>Would you like PEACE OF MIND?</h3>
                    <p>As an athlete, you know the four key factors that fuel good performance. Most of us concentrate on <em>Exercise, Nutrition and Recovery</em>, but we ignore the impact of <em>Stress</em>. Life insurance helps reduce that stress; delivering peace of mind by providing coverage to your family should the unexpected ever happen.</p>
